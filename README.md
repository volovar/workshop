# The Workshop

This page is a junk drawer for random code I've written. It's mostly random test and exercises I've been working on to be a better programmer. The exercises are from a fantastic book called [**Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills.**](http://amzn.to/1KVbPfJ) Everything that follows is HTML and Javascript, but there are some other variants (so far only Ruby) in the [**repository.**](https://github.com/volovar/workshop) If you have any suggestions, let me know.
